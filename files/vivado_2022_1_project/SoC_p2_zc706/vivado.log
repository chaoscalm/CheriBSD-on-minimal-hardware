Debug nets, which are already connected to any ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. 
WARNING: [SMARTCONNECT-2] Port M01_AXI of /smartconnect_0 is connected to an infrastructure IP (/axi_clock_converter_0).  It is recommended to attach AXI SmartConnect directly to endpoint IPs to avoid mismatches or other issues during validation.  If mismatches occur, manually assign values for AXI Interface properties of /axi_clock_converter_0.
INFO: [xilinx.com:ip:smartconnect:1.0-1] p2_ddr3_smartconnect_0_0: SmartConnect p2_ddr3_smartconnect_0_0 is in High-performance Mode.
