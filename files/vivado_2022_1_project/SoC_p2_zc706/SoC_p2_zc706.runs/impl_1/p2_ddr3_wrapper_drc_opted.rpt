If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.

REQP-1839#17 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 p2_ddr3_i/mkP2_Core_1/inst/core/core/axi4_mem_shim_tmp_tagCon/tagLookup_tagCache_data_0_bram_bram/RAM_reg has an input control pin p2_ddr3_i/mkP2_Core_1/inst/core/core/axi4_mem_shim_tmp_tagCon/tagLookup_tagCache_data_0_bram_bram/RAM_reg/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: p2_ddr3_i/mkP2_Core_1/inst/core/core/axi4_mem_shim_tmp_tagCon/tagLookup_tagCache_data_0_bram_bram/ADDRARDADDR[6]) which is driven by a register (p2_ddr3_i/mkP2_Core_1/inst/core/core/axi4_mem_shim_tmp_tagCon/tagLookup_tagCache_orderer_mastReqIds_lhead_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
